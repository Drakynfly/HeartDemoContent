# Heart Demo Content

This is a WIP plugin containing example implementations of Heart Graph, serving as both my personal testing ground for developing Heart, and as a living documentation of what it can do.

(current progress: 1.5/5)

As I continue work on Heart Graph, this project is used to help me determine which features are most important for real-world use.

## Demos: 

1. Calculator Graph (Basic features complete)
   - Blueprint-only
   - Demonstrates "live" graph compilation, runtime node editing, node palette
2. Perk Tree (WIP)
   - Blueprint-only
   - Can be edited from Editor or Runtime
   - Will be used for fleshing out more advanced node action behavior
   - Showcase HeartCanvas's visual design tools, with both 2D and 3D visualizers
3. Level Selection Screen (Planned)
   - A 3D enviroment where each node represents a mission or level
   - Showcases 3D graph capability with Actors & Scene Components being used to represent Nodes & Pins
4. Runtime FlowGraph (Planned)
   - Adapts MothDocter's FlowGraph for runtime
   - Serializes graphs for saving/loading to file
5. A Sebastian Lague style cpu simulator (Planned)
   - A huge planned experiment to test automatic-caching of truth tables, gray codes, and simulated analog computation, among other things.
   - This demo will take the most time, and will likely be the last one I get too. Don't hold your breath. This is basically just a teaser of something I'll do to when I have time :)
